# ITMD-362-Project-2

/* I learned a lot over the course of this project. It was cool to redesign an existing webpage rather than create one completely from scratch. I had origanally planned on doing a few things differently for the project, but ran into some issues that required me to change my plans. this tought me a lot about how original plans should be thought out a bit more. As with the coding I learned quite a bit from the start of the class until now. Mainly with the mobile css. */
